Summary: Lionsgate, the studio behind films like The Hunger Games, John Wick, and Saw, is partnering with AI video generation company [Runway](https://runwayml.com/news/runway-partners-with-lionsgate) to create a custom AI model trained on its film catalog.

Details:

- The collaboration will develop an AI model trained specifically on Lionsgate's proprietary content library, designed to generate film-style video that filmmakers can manipulate further using Runway's tools.
- Lionsgate views AI as a tool to enhance its current operations, streamlining pre-production and post-production processes.
- Runway is considering how to offer similar custom-trained models as templates for individual creators, expanding access to AI-driven filmmaking tools beyond major studios.

Why it matters: While many writers, actors, and filmmakers went on strike against ChatGPT, Lionsgate is diving headfirst into the world of generative AI. This is one of the first major partnerships between an AI startup and a major Hollywood playerâ€”its success or failure could set a precedent for years to come.
